# Site-specific cooperativity

Interactive notebooks relating to the description of site-specific cooperative ligand binding.

Notebook 1 outlines a binary notation to represent the ligand binding configurations 
(i.e. the thermodynamic states).
Notebook 2 outlines a hierarchical parameterization to represent the binding affinities and
the coupling between binding at different sites (i.e. the thermodynamic parameters).
Notebook 3 gives examples of how to generate customized models based on the binary notation 
and hierarchical parameterization.

site_specific_model.py and site_specific_utilities.py provide computation tools underlying
Notebook 3.
